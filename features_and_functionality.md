# Features and Functionality Overview

## Overview

The Cognitive Assistant project integrates AI models like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) into a React Native app with a Flask back-end. This setup allows users to manage tasks, receive AI-driven recommendations, and interact with a knowledge graph.

## Features

### 1. Task Management

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks through the React Native interface.
- **View Tasks**: Users can view a list of their tasks, along with their status.
- **Manage Task Status**: Future enhancements include updating and categorizing tasks.

### 2. Reinforcement Learning (RL) Integration

- **RL Agent**: Uses a custom RL agent trained with PPO to make decisions based on user inputs.
- **Action Recommendations**: The RL component provides actions that can be taken based on the current state.

### 3. Graph Neural Network (GNN) Integration

- **Knowledge Graph Queries**: Users can query the knowledge graph, and the GNN processes these queries to provide relevant insights.
- **Dynamic Learning**: The GNN is designed to learn from interactions and improve its recommendations over time.

### 4. Front-End (React Native)

- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on both iOS and Android, with potential expansion to Apple Watch.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with responsive design principles to ensure smooth user experiences on various devices.

## Future Enhancements

- **Apple Watch Integration**: Extend functionality to the Apple Watch for quick task updates and notifications.
- **Advanced AI Features**: Expand the AI capabilities with more complex decision-making and context-aware interactions.
- **Security and Privacy**: Implement robust security measures to protect user data and ensure privacy compliance.
