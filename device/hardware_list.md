For your Google Glass-style headpiece project, you have all the essential components. The only additional items you might want to consider are:
Optional but Useful

    Small zip ties for cable management
    Double-sided tape or mounting adhesive
    Kapton tape for insulating components
    Small screwdriver set for any adjustments

Component Placement
Camera Module (OV2640-75MM)

    Position at front/temple area
    Use the 75mm flex cable to route behind the ear
    Angle slightly downward for natural field of view

ESP32 Board

    Place behind the ear where the temple piece widens
    This provides more surface area for mounting
    Helps balance weight distribution

Power/Charging

    PowerBoost 1000C near ESP32
    USB charging port positioned at bottom/rear of temple piece
    Easy access for charging while device is off

Audio Components

    Speaker

    Position near but not directly on ear
    Angle toward ear canal
    Consider bone conduction placement option

    MEMS Microphone

    Place near mouth/jaw area
    Keep away from speaker to prevent feedback
    Angle toward mouth for better voice capture

Design Considerations

    Route flex cables and wires through temple piece interior
    Add ventilation holes for heat dissipation near ESP32
    Include small LED status indicators visible to user
    Consider making temple piece slightly wider to accommodate components
    Use heat shrink tubing for wire management
    Add strain relief for charging port
