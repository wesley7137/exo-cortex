The AI Customization Service offers a revolutionary way for individuals to create personalized AI companions—intelligent assistants, coaches, or external cognitive partners—fine-tuned to their specific needs and preferences. Powered by the highly efficient LLaMA 3B model, this service allows users to customize their AI with traits such as communication style, personality, and areas of expertise (e.g., fitness, mental wellness, professional advice). Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning, the AI can be molded to suit various roles, whether as a conversational partner, task manager, or specialized advisor. The service also integrates an External Cortex feature, a customizable knowledge base that grows alongside the AI. Users can store this knowledge base in their preferred location—whether on Google Drive, OneDrive, or locally on their devices—and enrich it with personal documents, external data, or contextually relevant information. The AI companion and External Cortex evolve together through periodic updates, much like how a smartphone updates, ensuring both the AI’s cognitive capabilities and the user's knowledge repository expand in tandem. This cutting-edge product is deployable on any edge device, from smartphones and wearables to smart glasses and AI earpieces, giving users the freedom to access and interact with their AI anytime, anywhere. With built-in security, encrypted data storage, and seamless integration, this service represents the future of personalized AI, delivering a deeply customized, secure, and evolving personal assistant that adapts to each user’s unique life.

Full System Development and Features Plan for Personalized AI Customization Service with External Cortex

    User Profile and Registration
        OAuth and Profile Setup: Users register via OAuth (Google, Microsoft) or email-based accounts.
        Profile Customization: Users define preferences such as personality traits, AI tasks, and use cases (e.g., assistant, coach, companion).

    Model Selection and Customization
        LLaMA 3B Base Model: Leverage the LLaMA 3B model for all customizations due to its efficiency and edge device compatibility.
        Custom Trait Selection: Users select from a range of customizable traits (e.g., personality, communication style) and specializations (e.g., fitness, productivity, healthcare).
        LoRA Fine-Tuning: Use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model for different traits and specializations. Fine-tuning can be updated over time.

    External Cortex/Knowledge Base
        Storage Options: Users can choose where to store their external cortex, such as:
            Cloud-Based Storage: Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox.
            Local Storage: User devices (PCs, mobile, edge devices).
        Vector Database Integration: Store knowledge base data as a vector database for easy search and retrieval of user-specific information. The cortex can contain user-uploaded documents, notes, preferences, etc.
        Knowledge Graph: Optionally, the external cortex can be represented as a knowledge graph, capturing relationships between different pieces of knowledge.
        External Data Sources: Allow users to connect third-party APIs (e.g., PubMed, Wikipedia) to enrich their knowledge base.
        External Cortex Expansion: The AI continuously interacts with the knowledge base, updating the user's external cortex based on interactions, queries, and personalized experiences.

    AI and External Cortex Synchronization and Updates
        Periodic AI Model Updates: Similar to phone software updates, the AI model will have scheduled updates to improve efficiency, learn from new user interactions, and adapt to changing preferences.
            AI Growth: The model adapts and evolves with usage, integrating the external cortex for improved decision-making and contextual responses.
        External Cortex Updates: The external cortex (knowledge base) also updates when new documents or relevant data are added, ensuring it grows alongside the AI.
        Seamless Model + Cortex Updates: The update process covers both the AI model and the external cortex simultaneously. This ensures that both the AI's capabilities and the user's knowledge base remain aligned and up to date.

    Device Deployment
        Edge Device Deployment: Users can deploy their fine-tuned AI model (and synced external cortex) to edge devices, such as smartphones, AR glasses, AI earpieces, etc.
        Model Compression: Optimize the AI and external cortex for edge devices by using quantization techniques and lightweight vector databases.
        API and SDK: Provide easy integration and deployment via SDKs or APIs for user applications or third-party platforms.

    Real-Time Interaction and Updates
        Interaction with the AI Companion: Through a dedicated app or device interface (e.g., earpiece, phone), users can interact with their AI, query the external cortex, or receive suggestions.
        AI Feedback Loop: The AI learns from each interaction, updating both itself and the external cortex to better serve the user’s needs.
        Push Updates for AI & Cortex: Users are notified about AI and external cortex updates and can choose when to apply them, similar to mobile software update notifications.
